Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to address you today at this landmark summit. I thank President Biden for taking the initiative to coordinate international response to the most important current threat, the new Coronavirus. It is of utmost importance to think and plan globally to emerge victorious in this fight. Solidarity is a global imperative. I believe that the best way to ensure our safety is a fair access to life saving vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. As part of the international efforts to combat the Pandemic, romania hosts the Risk EU, a strategic medical reserve and distribution mechanism of the European Union. Romania has helped other countries in their efforts to mitigate the devastating effects of the pandemic by sending medical teams to Italy, the Republic of Moldova, and Tunisia, but also to the United States. I would like to emphasize the Romanian contribution. In May 2020, with medical personnel and experts deployed to Alabama. Furthermore, Romania already donated vaccine doses to the Republic of Moldova, the Ukraine, Serbia, Georgia, Albania, Egypt, Tunisia and Vietnam. Romania commits to the ambitious agenda that reinforces the health, security, architecture of the world in order to build a global system that is resilient and better suited to manage unforeseen cris such as this pandemic. Thank you very much.
