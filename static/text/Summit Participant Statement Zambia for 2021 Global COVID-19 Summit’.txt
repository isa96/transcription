Mr. President, Zambia is pleased to join other countries and organizations in the Global COVID-19 Summit themed Ending the Pandemic and Building Back Better COVID-19 is undoubtedly the greatest public health challenge. In recent times, it has claimed countless lives, disrupted livelihoods, and kept our children out of school will contributing towards global economic slowdown. We have an eligible population of 8.4 million people, and we aim to vaccinate at least 70% of these by the third quarter of 2022. Our government appreciates global efforts aimed at making vaccines available to low and middle income countries through the COVAX facility, as well as the regional initiative of the African Union through the Africa Vaccination Acquisition Trust Abbott. In this regard, we wish to appeal for scaling up of these efforts to enable the attainment of the commitments we are making today. As a country, our efforts will focus on pushing back against misinformation myths and misconceptions that have led to some hesitance amongst our population for taking the COVID-19 Vaccinations. In addition, we are rebuilding our economy in order to provide opportunities for all to ensure sustainable livelihoods and improve access to quality education and health care services, all of which underpin a meaningful fight against the COVID-19 Pandemic. Further, Zambia remains committed to saving lives by ensuring heightened testing and scaling up the availability of oxygen. We further commit to ramping up the COVID-19 genomic sequencing in order to detect, monitor and mitigate against new variants. Zambia hosts the Southern Africa regional Collaborating Center of the Africa Center for Disease Control. Today, we make our resolve. We endorse the collective goals and targets of the Global COVID-19 Summit and pledge to accelerate our own efforts to contribute to ending the Pandemic at the earliest possible time and enhance global health security to combat future threats, I thank you.
